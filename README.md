# üöÄ Togedda - Collective Fitness Goals Platform

## üèÜ **Revolutionary Concept**

**Togedda** is evolving from a fitness-focused platform into a comprehensive **collective goals platform** that spans sports, creative pursuits, music, learning, and personal development. By integrating the Memory API, we create a unified identity graph that connects user achievements across all platforms and domains, enabling social reputation systems for real-world accomplishments.

### **Core Features**
- **Collective Goals**: Community-wide challenges across fitness, sports, creative pursuits, and learning
- **Prediction Markets**: Create and participate in achievement-based predictions with stake recovery
- **Unified Identity Graph**: Cross-platform reputation using Memory API (wallet + Farcaster + Twitter + more)
- **Cross-Chain Achievement Tracking**: Record accomplishments across multiple blockchain networks
- **XMTP AI Assistant**: Natural language goal creation and social interaction
- **Social Reputation System**: Follow-graph leaderboards and personality profile analysis
